## Usage

> Some usage instructions:
> 1) npm install -g webpack & npm install dependencies.
> 2) package.json file has scripts, look at the script "npm run seed." This is the script that will populate all the data into mongo.
> If everything went according to plan there should be a "data.json" file in the seed folder showing what was loaded in a JSON format.
>   Note: You might have to update the configs in the "db-models/database.js" file to include your own MONGO_URI to connect to your database first.
>   I have my MONGO_URI saved to a .gitignore'd file so I'm guessing most likely you'll have to make sure you can connect to your own mongodb.
> 3) The script "npm run start" will start the "server.js" file. The command its running is "node ./server/server".
> 4) Everything should be working ...I'm hoping it does ðŸ˜¬ !
